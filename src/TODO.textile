h1. Snow Runtime TODO

h2. Optimizations

* General Performance
** Lots of things can be inlined.
** Use MurmurHash for string hashing in data structures.
** Assembler: Currently uses <code>std::vector<byte></code> for instruction emission. We can do better.
** x86-64: Optionally detect and remove redundant instructions.
* Memory Usage
** <code>sizeof(std::unordered_map<std::string, ValueHandle>) == 48</code>  -- Can this be improved? Maybe with a custom HashMap? Google's dense_map?
** Improve Codegen so we only need to store Scopes that are actually referenced by a function.
** Array: Resize only allocates precisely as much as needed, not good for growing arrays.
* Garbage Collector / Allocator
** Freelists.
** Currently reallocates way too much, and is pretty blind to common cases. Add heuristics.
