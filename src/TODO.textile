h1. Snow Runtime TODO

h2. Optimizations

* General Performance
** Lots of things can be inlined.
** Use MurmurHash for string hashing in data structures.
** Assembler: Currently uses <code>std::vector<byte></code> for instruction emission. We can do better.
** x86-64: Optionally detect and remove redundant instructions.
** Possible idea: Symbols (like Ruby). Could be used internally without syntax, or with special syntax.
* Memory Usage
** <code>sizeof(std::unordered_map<std::string, ValueHandle>) == 48</code>  -- Can this be improved? Maybe with a custom HashMap? Google's dense_map?
** Improve Codegen so we only need to store Scopes that are actually referenced by a function.
** Array: Resize only allocates precisely as much as needed, not good for growing arrays.
* Garbage Collector / Allocator
** Freelists.


h2. Bugs

* Codegen strings (identifiers, etc.) are pointers directly into the AST, which is probably freed before execution. Possible solution: malloc allocator.
* Global scope isn't shared among calls to require() and eval().

h2. 0.1 Milestone Missing Features

* Complete GC
