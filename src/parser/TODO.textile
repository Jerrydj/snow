h1. Things to do!

*Disclaimer:* This is not an accurate roadmap, but simply whatever came to my mind when I wrote it. More is very likely to come.

h2. 0.1 Milestone

What needs doing parser/scanner-wise before Snow the Language can be considered a decent place to start:

* String interpolation
* Regular expressions as literals?
** Either way, implement in AST + Codegen + Runtime.
* Else-if
* General clean-up and tidying of grammar.
** function_call needs a lot of love.
