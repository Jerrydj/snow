h1. Things to do!

*Disclaimer:* This is not an accurate roadmap, but simply whatever came to my mind when I wrote it. More is very likely to come.

h2. 0.1 Milestone

No, really, I just made it up. I don't think we have any milestones. Anyway...

* Literals:
** Integers in binary (0b10111 and whatnot)
** Strings
*** ...with interpolation...
* Comments
** Long (/* .. */)
** Short (// ..)
** ...with proper nesting...
* Control structures
** If
*** if .. [elsif ..] else .. end
*** unless .. [elsif ..] else .. end
** Throw / catch
*** throw
*** catch .. end
* Function-calls as commands.
* Optimize lexer with a keyword table instead of a friggin' long list of keywords. I know, it's amateurish.
* Assign proper, AST-generating actions to the parser. 

h2. Ideas for the next milestone

* Regular expressions using / .. /
* Switch .. case .. end
