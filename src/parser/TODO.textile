h1. Things to do!

*Disclaimer:* This is not an accurate roadmap, but simply whatever came to my mind when I wrote it. More is very likely to come.

h2. 0.1 Milestone

No, really, I just made it up. I don't think we have any milestones. Anyway...

* Grammar that still needs doing:
** Weirdness in arguments symbol needs fixing.
** Logical and bitwise operations.

* C++ driver/lexer/parser framework
** Optimize lexer with a keyword table instead of a friggin' long list of keywords. I know, it's amateurish.
** Assign proper, AST-generating actions to the parser.

* Finish TextMate bundle!

h2. Ideas for the next milestone

* Regular expressions using / .. /
* Switch .. case .. end
* String interpolation
* Long comments
