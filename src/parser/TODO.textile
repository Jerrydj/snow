h2. TODO:
Disclaimer: This is not an accurate roadmap, but simply whatever came to my mind when I wrote it. More is very likely to come.

h3. 0.1 Milestone
* Literals:
** true, false, nil. DONE!
** Floating point numbers. DONE!
** Binary numbers (0b[01]+)
** Strings
*** Interpolation
* Closures without reduce/reduce conflicts. DONE!
* Function-calls as commands.
* Optimize lexer with a keyword table instead of a friggin' long list of keywords. I know, it's amateurish.
* Assign proper, AST-generating actions to the parser. 

h3. 0.2 Milestone IDEAS:
* Regular expressions using / .. /
